# JavaMailApp
Simple email app to send emails through using a google account.

This is a simple mail app with 4 fields, Sender, Recipient, Subject, and Text. 

It is configured to send mail through a test Gmail account I created.

There are two additional classes that add the FocusListeners to make the text fields more user friendly.
